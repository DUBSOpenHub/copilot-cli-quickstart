## 🤔 What Is This?

**Copilot CLI Quick Start** is a [Copilot CLI skill](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) that teaches you how to use GitHub Copilot CLI — interactively, right inside your terminal. No docs to read. No videos to watch. Just you and a friendly AI tutor that walks you through everything step by step. 🎓

It features **two learning tracks** so everyone can learn at their own pace:
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Track** — terminal shortcuts, file mentions, custom instructions, MCP, and more
- 🎨 **Non-Developer Track** — writing, task planning, understanding code, and getting summaries

Designed for **absolute beginners**. Even if you've never touched a terminal, we've got you! 🫶

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) installed (`brew install copilot-cli` or `npm install -g @github/copilot`)
- An active [Copilot subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)

### Add the Skill

#### Option A: Personal Skill (works everywhere) ⭐ Recommended

Clone the repo and copy the skill to your personal skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/copilot-cli-quickstart.git
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills
cp -r copilot-cli-quickstart/.github/skills/copilot-cli-quickstart ~/.copilot/skills/
```

Then in a Copilot CLI session, run `/skills reload` to pick it up.

#### Option B: Project Skill (auto-discovered)

Clone the repo and start Copilot CLI from inside it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/copilot-cli-quickstart.git

## 🔧 Top Troubleshooting

### 🚨 Skill Add Issues

**Symptom:** Skill doesn't appear in `/skills list` or isn't activating.

**Fixes:**
- ✅ **Check skill location** — The `SKILL.md` file must be in either `~/.copilot/skills/copilot-cli-quickstart/SKILL.md` (personal) or `.github/skills/copilot-cli-quickstart/SKILL.md` (project, auto-discovered when you `cd` into the repo).
- ✅ **Reload skills** — Run `/skills reload` in your Copilot CLI session after copying files.
- ✅ **Verify CLI version** — Run `copilot --version` outside the CLI session. Update if needed: `brew upgrade copilot-cli` or `npm update -g @github/copilot`.

---

### 🔐 Authentication / Subscription Issues

**Symptom:** "Copilot not enabled" or authentication errors when trying to use the CLI.

**Fixes:**
- ✅ **Verify subscription** — Check [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot) to confirm you have an active Copilot subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise).
- ✅ **Re-authenticate** — Run `copilot auth logout` then `copilot auth login` outside the CLI session. Follow the browser login flow.
- ✅ **Check permissions** — For organizations, confirm your org admin has enabled Copilot for your account. Check with your GitHub admin if unsure.

---

### 🛡️ Permission Prompts Confusion

**Symptom:** Copilot keeps asking "Allow", "Deny", or "Allow for session" and I'm not sure which to choose.

**Explanation:**
- ✅ **Allow** — Copilot performs this action once, then asks again next time.
- ❌ **Deny** — Copilot won't do this action. Totally safe! Nothing bad happens if you deny.
- 🔄 **Allow for session** — Copilot can do this type of action for the rest of this session without asking again. Use this to speed up repetitive tasks (e.g., if it's creating multiple files).

**Pro tip:** When learning, use "Allow" (not "Allow for session") so you see what Copilot does each time. You can always deny — Copilot respects your choice! 🎮

---

### 📎 File Mention `@` Not Autocompleting

**Symptom:** Typing `@` doesn't show files or autocomplete doesn't work.

**Fixes:**
- ✅ **Be in a directory with files** — File mentions (`@filename`) only work when you're in a directory that contains files. Navigate to a project folder first: `cd ~/my-project`.
- ✅ **Use full paths if needed** — If autocomplete isn't working, type the full path: `@/path/to/file.js` or `@./relative/file.js`.
- ✅ **Check Copilot CLI version** — File mentions require Copilot CLI v1.5.0+. Run `copilot --version` to check.

---

### 🪟 Windows Shell Gotchas

**Symptom:** Commands don't work as expected on Windows.

**Fixes:**
- ✅ **Use PowerShell or Windows Terminal** — Copilot CLI works best with PowerShell 7+ or Windows Terminal (not legacy cmd.exe).
- ✅ **Path separators** — Use forward slashes `/` or escape backslashes `\\` in paths. Copilot CLI normalizes paths, but Windows tools may be picky.
- ✅ **Run as user (not admin)** — Run Copilot CLI as your regular user. Admin mode can cause permission issues with Git and npm.
